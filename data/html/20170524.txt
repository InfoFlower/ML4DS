Telegram Channel Get Bitcoin News stories in Telegram Dismiss PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT Bitcoincom is of the opinion that the current Bitcoin Core Blockstream Bitcoin development team is not taking satisfactory steps to ensure the growth and advancement of Bitcoin in accordance with Satoshis original white paper and is in fact actively harming the health of the Bitcoin economy by stifling efforts to solve some of Bitcoins most pressing problems Rather than viewing Bitcoin as a fast affordable and reliable payments network as it has been for years they aim to transform Bitcoin into what they call a settlement layer defined by high fees unreliable transactions and a labyrinth of complex overlays that require thirdparty trust on top of the basic system This development team has further prevented the ability of the Bitcoin community to freely discuss this radical change of direction by tacitly and in some cases explicitly supporting censorship of Bitcoins largest discussion forums along with the outright banning of many prominent developers businesses and community members who have differences of opinion with Bitcoin Cores current roadmap After years of stagnation stalling and broken promises it has become clear that positive change will not come from Bitcoin Core but rather from the diverse group of alternate development teams that have emerged as a result of Cores tactics The following article cites a thorough history with specific examples of the rampant censorship on the rbitcoin subreddit A Brief and Incomplete History of Censorship in rbitcoin by John Blocke As efforts by the community to resolve these problems have failed it is necessary to resolve them with a different approach By unsubscribing from rbitcoin and subscribing to subreddit rbtc you take a stand against censorship By running an alternate implementation such as Bitcoin Unlimited Bitcoin Classic or Bcoin you are casting a vote against the current development team There are currently cryptocurrencies which perform better than Bitcoin have more features than Bitcoin have a more receptive and open development team than Bitcoin and have a better upgrade path than Bitcoin The single and only remaining quality that Bitcoin has over these other cryptocurrencies is firstmover advantage and its preexisting network of users and infrastructure If these qualities are not preserved Bitcoin will continue to lose market share to competing cryptocurrencies The current Bitcoin Core developers are rapidly eroding this last advantage with poor design choices a failure to understand basic economic principles and promoting censorship through their support of censored discussion forums and their vilification of forums committed to free speech We encourage all members of the Bitcoin
